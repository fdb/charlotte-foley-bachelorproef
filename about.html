          <p> This is a project that visually explores and researches the <i>(Irish)</i> multigenerational trauma and complex relationship with alcohol-(addiction),
            from the perspective of those affected. I want to reduce the shame that is attached to the topic, by shining light on it. No longer hiding or supressing everything,
            giving it exposure. Giving those who are direclty affected a voice.</p>
            I like to dedicate this project to whoever has been affected by this problem. </p>
